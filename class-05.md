# Images
  * Images should be relevant
  * Convey Information
  * Convey the right mood
  * Be instantly recognisable
  * Fit the color palette

  ##### Syntax - 
    > < img > this is how you add an element to the page
    > src - tells the browser where to look for the image
    > alt - provides a text description of the image if you cannot see it
    > title - you can also title the attribute with the < img > element to provide additional information about the image. 
    > height - this specifies the height of the image in pixels
    > width - this specifies the width of the image in pixels


    * Where to place images in code - you can put them anywhere in HTML but they will stay relative to the positioning around them if you do.  CSS will help styling. 
    * Three Rules for Creating Images
      1. Save images in the right format
      1. Save images at the right size
      1. Use the correct resolution

    * Image formats; jpeg, gif, 

    * Images should be saved at a resolution of 72dpi.  The higher the resolution, the higher the image size. 

    * < figure > and < ficaption > give the way a designer to add a caption.

  ## Color - one of my favorite topics;

      * Foreground color - color 
      * background color - background-color
      * You can use either a few color names, RGB values, or hex codes. 
      * Opacity - opacity
      * HSL colors - Hue, Saturation, and Lightness

      ***

  ## Text - a very close second

      * Serif fonts - have extra details on the ends of the letters
      * Sans-serif - have straight ends to the letters
      * Monospace - Every letter has a fixed width

      * If you design on a Mac, it is important to check what the typefaces look like on a PC because PCs can render type less smoothly. But if you design on a PC, then it should look fine on a Mac.

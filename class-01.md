# HTML Design
> Decide who the website is going to be designed for?

>Why are people going to your website?

>What are consumers trying to get out of your site

## What should you include in your website

> Header

> Footer

> Body

> Descriptions

> Images

Input | Result
------------ | -------------

 ### Create your framework first
 > Draw out/sketch out skeleton

 > Make sure to have < !doctype html > at the beginning of your code

 > Make sure to have both opening and closing marks <> </>

 > Write your code much like you are writing a book. Start at the top and work your way down.  Create a rough outline first, and then go back through to get all of the details down. 


## Java Reading
* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal
Some scripts are simple and only deal with one individual scenario, like a simple recipe for a basic dish. Other scripts can perform many tasks, like a recipe for a complicated three-course meal.

* Scripts can allow the browser to check the current situation and only perform a set of steps if that action is appropriate.

* Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step.

* A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.

* Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.

* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

* A script is just a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem in hand.

* Steps to coding in Java
Define the goal
Design the script
Code each step
Vocabulary: The words that computers understand
Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow
Flow charts help with the organization and functionality of the code.
Expressions
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.

* Each of the lines of code in green is a statement.

* The pink curly braces indicate the start and end of a code block. (Each code block could contain many more statements.)

* The code in purple determines which code should run

* Javascript is case sensitive
STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE
A statement is an individual instruction that the computer should follow. Each one should start on a new line and end with a semicolon. This makes your code easier to read and follow.

* The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter when a step is over, indicating that it should move to the next step.

* STATEMENTS CAN BE ORGANIZED INTO CODE BLOCKS
Some statements are surrounded by curly braces; these are known as code blocks. The closing curly brace is not followed by a semicolon.

* Comments
You should write comments explaining what your code does. This will make your code easier to understand.

>>To write a comment that stretches over more than one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with the /* characters and ending with the */ characters. Anything between these characters is not processed by the JavaScript interpreter.
In a single-line comment, anything that follows the two forward slash characters // on that line will not be processed by the JavaScript interpreter. Single-line comments are often used for short descriptions of what the code is doing.
* Var is an example of what programmers call a keyword. The JavaScript interpreter knows that this keyword is used to create a variable. In order to use the variable, you must give it a name. If a variable name is more than one word, it is usually written in camelCase. This means the first word is all lowercase and any subsequent words have their first letter capitalized.
Until you have assigned a value to a variable, programmers say the value is undefined.

* BOOLEAN DATA TYPE Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false.

* STRING DATA TYPE The strings data type consists of letters and other characters.

* If you start with a single quote, you must end with a single quote, and if you start with a double quote, you must end with a double quote:

* Quotes should be straight (not curly) quotes:

* Strings must always be written on one line:

#### Functions
> Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. The steps that the function needs to perform in order to perform its task are packaged up in a code block. Some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task

> Parameters : pieces of information passed to a function.
Return value : When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer
Functions store the code required to perform a specific task, and that the script can ask the function to perform that task whenever needed.
If different parts of a script need to perform the same task, you do not need to repeat the same statements multiple times - you use a function to do it (and reuse the same code).

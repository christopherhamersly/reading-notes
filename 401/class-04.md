Why would a developer choose to make data models? 
  - Models promote consensus among developers, customers and other stakeholders. A data model also promotes agreement on vocabulary and jargon. The model highlights the chosen terms so that they can be driven forward into software artifacts.

What purpose do CRUD operations serve? 
  - In computer programming, create, read (aka retrieve), update, and delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic functions of CRUD, such as retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete

What kind of database is Postgres? 
  - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

What kind of database is MongoDB? 
  -  MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL). What is Mongoose and why do we need it? - Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.

  - For my 301 final project, we made several API calls, and they were all based on the location. One type of data would be location, type of activity, and details for each activity for each location. Each location has a type of activity, and each activity has details for each location.

database 
  -  A database is a repository of information managed by a database engine which ensures integrity of data and fast access to the data. A very common implementation of a database is a Relational Database Management System (RDBM). ... However, SQL only provides commands to access and manipulate the data in the database.

data model 
  -  A data model explicitly determines the structure of data CRUD create, update, read, and delete. 
schema 
  -  organization or structure for a database. 
sanitize 
  -  to clean the data, making sure people aren't allowed to read your secrets. 
Structured Query Language (SQL) 
  -  is a language that allows programmers to manipulate data sets in a table. 
Non SQL (NoSQL) 
  -  is a database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. 
MongoDB  
  -  is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Mongoose - is a library used for Mongo DB and node. 
record 
  - record (also called a structure, struct, or compound data) is a basic data structure. Records in a database or spreadsheet are usually called "rows" 
    - (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science) 
document 
  - In computer hardware and software product development, documentation is the information that describes the product to its users.

Object Relation Mapping (ORM) 
  - is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

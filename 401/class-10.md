## Stacks and Queues

Stack - 
  - A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Common Terminology for a stack is;
1. Push 
  - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
1. Pop 
  - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
1. Top 
  - This is the top of the stack.
1. Peek 
  - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
1. IsEmpty 
  - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

Stacks follow these concepts:

- FILO
  - First In Last Out

  - This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

- LIFO
  - Last In First Out

  - This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

- Push O(1)
  - Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

- Pop O(1)
  - Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.

- Peek O(1)
  - When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

  - Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.


- Common terminology for a queue is

1. Enqueue 
  -  Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
1. Dequeue 
  - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
1. Front 
  - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
1. Rear 
  - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
1. Peek   
  - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
1. IsEmpty 
  - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

- Queues follow these concepts:

- FIFO
  - First In First Out

  - This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

- LILO
  - Last In Last Out

  - This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

- Enqueue O(1)
  - When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

- Dequeue O(1)
  - When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

- Peek O(1)
  - When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

  - Typically, you want to check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

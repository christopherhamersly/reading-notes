# Component Based UI

1. Does a deployed React application require a server?
  - React. js does not use a web server to create virtual DOMs. It builds the virtual DOM and does its diff operations on the client's browser

1. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit 
level?
  - BDD uses human-readable descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests.  Designing these kinds of user requirements up front can save a lot of rework later in the process, by helping the team and customers get on the same page about what product you are building.  

1. What does npm run build do?
  - npm run build does nothing unless you specify what "build" does in your package. json file. It lets you perform any necessary building/prep tasks for your project, prior to it being used in another project

1. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
  -  React doesn't enforce an architecture pattern.  It is just a view that caters to the user interface. 

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
  -  React itself.  I've always heard of frameworks from my classmates who may have had experience with them, but I am excited to finally see them in practice.   

1. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
  -  Really hoping to learn how all of the components fit together. 
  - Curious to know how each app differs from eachother
  -  Also, extremely curious to see a very complicated app vs a very basic app.

1. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
  -  Most excited to get back to a front end.  I'm sure its going to be extremely tough, but stoked to get back to see something happen on the front end.

### Terms

1. BDD 
  - behavior driven development
1. Acceptance Tests
  - Formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria [2] and to enable the user, customers or other authorized entity to determine whether to accept the system.
1. mounting
  - the software process that activates a particular disk by making its content available to the computer's file system. Mounting creates a partition for the mounted device in the computer's file system.
1. build
  - the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifact(s) that can be run on a computer, or the result of doing so

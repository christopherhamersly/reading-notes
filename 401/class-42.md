"The employee backlash over Google’s censored search engine for China, explained"

- About 1,400 Google employees — out of the more than 88,000 — signed a letter to company executives this week, seeking more details and transparency about the project and demanding employee input in decisions about what kind of work Google takes on. They also expressed concern that the company is violating its own ethical principles.
- Currently we do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment,” they wrote in the letter.
- The existence of the censored search tool — dubbed Dragonfly — was revealed earlier this month by the Intercept, sparking outcry within the company’s ranks and drawing harsh criticism from human rights groups across the world. Internal documents leaked to journalists described how the app-based search platform could block internet users in China from seeing web pages that discuss human rights, peaceful protests, democracy and other topics blacklisted by China’s authoritarian government
- The fact that Google employees succeeded in forcing one of the most powerful companies in the world to put ethics before shareholder value is a remarkable feat in corporate America, and signals why workers need an official voice in strategic decisions. Whether or not Google ultimately drops its plan to help China censor information will be a test of how far that power extends.
- Facebook is still banned in China, but chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has been trying to change that. In 2016, news surfaced that Facebook was building a censorship tool similar to Google’s Dragonfly project: It would allow a third-party to block certain Facebook posts in China in exchange for the government’s permission to operate the social media network there.
-  My biggest takeway is that in order to make profit, much like other industries and fields, companies often have to bend to the will of the party in charge.  At times, they may have to do things that do not line up with the companies mission statement.

Morality, ethics of a self-driving car: Who decides who lives, dies?

- It’s a bright, sunny day and you’re alone in your spanking new self-driving vehicle, sprinting along the two-lane Tunnel of Trees on M-119 high above Lake Michigan north of Harbor Springs. You’re sitting back, enjoying the view. You’re looking out through the trees, trying to get a glimpse of the crystal blue water below you, moving along at the 45-m.p.h. speed limit.

As you approach a rise in the road, heading south, a school bus appears, driving north, one driven by a human, and it veers sharply toward you. There is no time to stop safely, and no time for you to take control of the car.
- It's not just a theoretical question anymore, with predictions that in a few years, tens of thousands of semi-autonomous vehicles may be on the roads. About $80 billion has been invested in the field. Tech companies are working feverishly on them, with Google-affiliated Waymo among those testing cars in Michigan, and mobility companies like Uber and Tesla racing to beat them. Detroit’s automakers are placing a big bet on them. A testing facility to hurry along research is being built at Willow Run in Ypsilanti.

- My biggest takeaway from this reading is the fact that technology companies owe it not only to their stockholders, but also the public at large to do their due diligence.  The fate of the public is in the hands of many engineers, and a lot of testing, and breaking need to happen before this technology is available to the public at learge.

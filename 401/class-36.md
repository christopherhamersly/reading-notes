### Terms

1. cookies
  - redux-cookies-middleware is a Redux middleware which watches for changes in Redux state & stores them in browser cookie.
1. authorization
  - Authentication is essential to any real application. When going about authentication you must keep in mind that nothing changes with how you should organize your application and you should implement authentication in the same way you would any other feature.

  -Authorization is a process in which developers control the access to information by users and also limit the actions users can perform.

    - An authenticated user is a user who has identified themselves somehow (e.g., through a set of credentials). Authentication doesn't deal with access control. This is where authorization takes part in. Without proper authorization, a user can cause havoc in an app. A writer could delete other writer's articles or change their password. This is why authorization is as important as authentication.

1. conditional rendering
  -  Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

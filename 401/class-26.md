# Component Based UI

- Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
    - Aurelia
    - Polymer
    - Ember
    - Vue
    - Node.js

- Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
  - The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control". When you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you. ... The classes and methods normally define specific operations in a domain specific area.

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
  - Its interesting that when you are using a library, you had access to a method.  When using a framework, it controls the method.  

  - It seems like framworks are a little bit striclty managed to use, rather than framworks.

  - Framworks seem like they are the studs and foundation of the house.  It cannot change very easliy.  Libraries were tools to build the house in the way that you wanted to build them.  

Which 2 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
  - I'm really excited to see what the front end looks like again.  It seems like its been so long since I have seen any of the front end. 
  - I'm also excited to see whether or not the framworks have built in scaffolding, or if the the dev has to build up a lot of the functionality. 

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
  - I'm really excited to see the way in which the methods are called when using the framworks.

## Links
  * Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing. You will commonly come across the following types of links:
  * < a > < /a > - syntax for links. 
  * < a href = " url address ">TEXT< / a >
  * when linking to other pages within the same site, you do not have to specify the domain name, you can use shorthand. 
  * Trees of organization are much like a family tree.  Following grandparents and grandchildren. 
  * Email links are mailto: 
  * Opening a link in a new window is done by using the target command. target="_blank">
  * You can link to the same page by using the id attribute.

  ## Layout 
    * CSS treats each HTML element as if its in its own box.  The box will either be a block-level box or an inline box. 
      *  Block Level elements start a new line : < h1 > < p > < u l > < l i >
      * Inline elements include : < img > < b > < i >
      * Containing Elements - If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
      > It is common to group a number of elements together inside a < div >
      (or other block-level)
    * Controlling the position of elements - CSS has many positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page; normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. 
      >**Normal flow** - Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. Even if you specify the width of the boxes and there is space for two elements to sit side-byside, they will not appear next to each other. This is the default behavior (unless you tell the browser to do something else).
      > **Relative Positioning** - This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. This does not affect the position of surrounding elements; they stay in the position they would be in in normal flow.
      > **Absolute positioning** - This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements (as they simply ignore the space it would have taken up). Absolutely positioned elements move as users scroll up and down the page.

## Javascript
  > Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. 

  > To declare a function, you need to give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.  This is known as the function declaration. 

  > Having declared the function, you can then excecute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.  This is known as calling the function. 

  > Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task.  In such cases, when you declare the function you give it parameters.  Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.  

  > When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the paranthesis that follow its name.  The values are called arguments, and they can be provided as values or variables. 

  > Some functions return 
  information to the code that called them.  For example, when they perform a calculation, the return the result. 

  > Functions can return more than one value using an array.

  ## Paired Programming
   > Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
  
  >The **Driver** is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.

  >The **Navigator** uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

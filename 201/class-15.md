# What google learned from its quest to build the perfect team. 
  * The first part of the article is describing Rozovsky's experience in working with a group that she was 'assigned' to, vs a group that the she was chosen to be a part of.  She experienced that with her assigned group, she felt like people were jockeying for control of the group.  They had a similiar background, but she got along better with her chosen group.  She felt more free to explore her ideas in her chosen group. 
  * Collaboration in Silicon Valley has led to faster innovation. 
  * Google has an entire department dedicated to employees lives called 'Google's People Operations.'
  * In order to sort out what made for the best teams within Google, they created a project named Project Aristotle in order to study the teams. 
  * While researching what made a team succesful, they kept coming across 'group norms'.  Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. 
  * After doing research, they discovered that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google's teams. 
  * When doing the study, they gave the teams different random tasks and split them into groups.  They found that if the group succeeeded, they succeded at every task.  When they failed, they failed at every task. 
  * Most of the successful groups shared two behaviors.  First, on good teams, memebers spoke in roughly the same proportion, called "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking." Two, they also had "average social sensitivity", another way to say they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.  They also seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. 
  * Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety — a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a ‘‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’ Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’ Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’
  * Good leaders are direct and straightforward, taking the emotion out of the discusssion. 
  * Having "phschological safety" amongst groups is extremely necessary to have. 
  * One group at Google was thought to have been succesful, but when they filled out a survey, the leader was surprised by the results.  He realized they felt disconnected from the larger picture, and they were unhappy.  The leader started opening up about his personal life, and the rest of the team followed.  Bringing a new norm to the group.  
  * Succesful teams have people who don't have to leave their personality at home.  They feel fully present at work and feel psychologically safe.

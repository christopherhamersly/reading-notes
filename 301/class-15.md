# Diversity and Inclusion
1. Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago
  > In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male. In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.
  > The numbers of enrollments among men and women in computer science were on their way toward parity in the 1970s and early 1980s.
  > In 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women, but those numbers began to drop dramatically in the middle of the decade.
  >  According to a recent study conducted by Glassdoor, 11 of the 25 best-paying jobs are technology related, with an average earning potential of between $106,000 and $130,000 a year.
  > The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of computer and information-technology occupations will grow by 12% between 2014 and 2024, faster than the average for any other occupation.
  > Although a whole host of factors played a role in this phenomena, Elizabeth Ames from the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology believes that one of the primary reasons can be traced back to the close relationship between computing and gaming in the 1980s. 
  > the Apple personal computer that was released at the time was marketed specifically to boys
  > In 1983, the US experienced a video game recession. The market shrank from $3.2 billion in 1983 to $100 million in 1985, a drop of 97%. The crash was primarily brought about by low-quality games flooding the market, which smothered consumer confidence.
  > Advertisers sold games to boys because boys were the ones buying them, and boys were the ones buying them because of the advertisers’ targeted marketing.
  >  40% of male respondents passed the advanced-placement computer-science exam
  > Men were also more familiar with programming languages than women and were more likely to report having an “expert” level of programming proficiency before enrolling at Carnegie Mellon.
  > An American Association of University Women review of more than 380 studies from academic journals, corporations, and government sources found that more early exposure to engineering and computing among boys in school creates “more positive attitudes toward and interest in STEM subjects.”
  > Even when women do have considerable experience with coding and mathematics, the male-dominated environment that has arisen becomes an obstacle to entry for many.
  > Sax says she felt intimidated by the male-dominated culture she encountered at university.
  > The few women who do make it into the field are far less likely to stay than their male counterparts. The Center for Talent Innovation, a research think tank, found that US women are 45% more likely than men to leave careers in technology.
  
  ## Diversity in Tech

  1. Indie gogo is 50% male and female.  Pandora is a close second with 49% women.  To be honest, that is extremely shocking. 
  
  ## Why diversity matters to your tech company
  1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 
  1. Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation. 
  1. Diverse companies perform better
  1. Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.
  1. Companies are losing out on great talent
  1.  Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.
  1. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 
  1. When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
  1. It’s the right thing to do 
  1. While diversity and inclusion efforts are most often driven by business rationales, we’ve spoken with a few CEOs who are motivated primarily by a belief that cultivating an inclusive tech community is simply the right thing to do.
